  USB Video Class instance

  The Video Class will present a standard Zephyr video endpoint to which video buffers can be sent.
  These video buffers will be transmitted to the host over the UVC protocol.
  The USB descriptors communicating the capabilities of this UVC instance will be generated from
  the video device configured using uvc_set_video_dev().
