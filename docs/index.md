# tinyCLUNX33

The tinyCLUNX33 is a module built around the
[Lattice CrossLinkU-NX33 FPGA](https://www.latticesemi.com/en/Blog/2023/09/25/20/31/Accelerate-USB-enabled-Designs-with-Lattice-CrossLinkU-NX-FPGAs),
with **up to 14 MIPI lanes**,
featuring a **native USB 3.2 (5 Gbit/s) peripheral**,
capable of transferring application data at **3.4 Gbit/s at less than 200 mW**.

The [tinyCLUNX33 SoM](som.md) is a module that to plug into the [Devkit](carrier_devkit.md),
and a complete implementation of MIPI and USB protocols can be provided,
covering the **full chain from one or several sensors to the host**.

[Adapter boards](md_boards.html#autotoc_md12) can be built quickly to connect your sensor of choice, with the most common ones
[provided off-the-shelf](https://tinyvision.ai/collections/tinyclunx).
